The code in this repository currently relies on several other libraries, parts of libraries,
or external files: clblast, filesystem-1.5.8, half-2.1.0, httplib, mozilla-cacerts, nlohmann_json,
sgfmill, and tclap-1.2.2. For the licenses for those libraries and/or files, see the
individual readmes and/or license files for each one within their respective subdirectories within
cpp/external. Additionally, cpp/core/sha2.cpp derives from another piece of external code
and embeds its own license within that file.

Aside from the above, the license for all OTHER content in this repo is as follows:
