# Example config for C++ match runner
# This is an example template config for the "match" subcommand of KataGo. e.g:
# ./katago match -config-file configs/match_example.cfg -log-file match.log -sgf-output-dir match_sgfs/
#
# On a good GPU, the match subcommand enables testing of KataGo nets against each other
# or a net against itself with different parameters vastly faster than anything
# else, because multiple games can share GPU batching.
#
# Beware however of using this to test differing numbers of threads or test time-based search limits.
# Because many games will be run simultaneously, they will compete from each other for compute power,
# and although the total will run much faster than if you had run them one by one, you might also get
# substantially different results not reflective of the strength of a configuration when run in a real
# match setting, on a machine by itself. For fixed numbers of visits or playouts instead of fixed time,
# and with numSearchThreads = 1, there should be no problem though, because then the compute time has
# no influence on the result of the computation.
#
# See gtp config for descriptions of most of these params.
#
# For almost any parameter in this config that is related to a bot, rather than to the match as a whole
# (so, visits, search parameters, model files, etc. but NOT the rules, max games, log info, etc)
# you can specify them differentially between different bots by appending the index of the bot.
# For example, if you were testing different numbers of visits, you could try:
#
# numBots = 3
# botName0 = lowVisits
# botName1 = midVisits
# botName2 = highVisits
#
# maxVisits0 = 100
# maxVisits1 = 300
# maxVisits2 = 1000
#
# Or, if you were testing different neural nets, with different search configurations, you could do:
#
# nnModelFile0 = path/to/first/model/file.bin.gz
# nnModelFile1 = path/to/second/model/file.bin.gz
#
# And specify different search parameters for them if you wanted:
# cpuctExploration0 = 1.5
# cpuctExploration1 = 1.3
