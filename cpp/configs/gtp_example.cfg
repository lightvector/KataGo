# Config for C++ (non-python) gtp bot

# RUNNING ON AN ONLINE SERVER OR IN A REAL TOURNAMENT OR MATCH:
# If you plan to do so, you may want to read through the "Rules" section
# below carefully for proper handling of komi and handicap games and end-of-game cleanup
# and various other details.

# NOTES ABOUT PERFORMANCE AND MEMORY USAGE:
# You will likely want to tune one or more the following:
#
# numSearchThreads:
# The number of CPU threads to use. If your GPU is powerful, it can actually be much higher than
# the number of cores on your processor because you will need many threads to feed large enough
# batches to make good use of the GPU.
#
# The "./katago benchmark" command can help you tune this parameter, as well as to test out the effect
# of changes to any of the other parameters below!
#
# nnCacheSizePowerOfTwo:
# This controls the NN Cache size, which is the primary RAM/memory use.
# Increase this if you don't mind the memory use and want better performance for searches with
# tens of thousands of visits or more. Decrease this if you want to limit memory usage.
#
# If you're someone who is happy to do a bit of math - each neural net entry takes very
# approximately 1.5KB, except when using whole-board ownership/territory visualizations, each
# entry will take very approximately 3KB. The number of entries is (2 ** nnCacheSizePowerOfTwo),
# for example 2 ** 18 = 262144.
#
# OTHER NOTES:
# If you have more than one GPU, take a look at "OpenCL GPU settings" or "CUDA GPU settings" below.
#
# If using OpenCL, you will want to verify that KataGo is picking up the correct device!
# (e.g. some systems may have both an Intel CPU OpenCL and GPU OpenCL, if KataGo appears to pick
# the wrong one, you correct this by specifying "openclGpuToUse" below).
#
# You may also want to adjust "maxVisits", "ponderingEnabled", "resignThreshold", and possibly
# other parameters depending on your intended usage.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# For the `katago gtp` command, ALL of THE BELOW VALUES MAY BE SET OR OVERRIDDEN if desired via

# Analysis------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Configure the maximum length of analysis printed out by lz-analyze and other places.
# Controls the number of moves after the first move in a variation.
# analysisPVLen = 15

# Report winrates for chat and analysis as (BLACK|WHITE|SIDETOMOVE).
# Default is SIDETOMOVE, which is what tools that use LZ probably also expect
# reportAnalysisWinratesAs = SIDETOMOVE

# Uncomment and and set to a positive value to make KataGo explore the top move(s) less deeply and accurately,
# but explore and give evaluations to a greater variety of moves, for analysis (does NOT affect play).
# A value like 0.03 or 0.06 will give various mildly but still noticeably wider searches.
# An extreme value like 1 will distribute many playouts across every move on the board, even very bad moves.
# analysisWideRootNoise = 0.0


# Default rules------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# See https://lightvector.github.io/KataGo/rules.html for a description of the rules.
# These rules are defaults and can be changed mid-run by several custom GTP commands.
# See https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/blob/master/docs/GTP_Extensions.md for those commands.

# Some other legal values are: "chinese", "japanese", "korean", "aga", "chinese-ogs", "new-zealand".
# KataGo does not claim to exactly match any particular human ruleset, but KataGo will try to behave
# as closely as possible given the rules it has implemented.

# koRule = POSITIONAL   # Positional superko
# koRule = SITUATIONAL  # Situational superko

# scoringRule = AREA       # Area scoring
# scoringRule = TERRITORY  # Territory scoring (uses a sort of special computer-friendly territory ruleset)

# taxRule = NONE  # All surrounded empty points are scored
# taxRule = SEKI  # Eyes in seki do NOT count as points
# taxRule = ALL   # All groups are taxed up to 2 points for the two eyes needed to live

# multiStoneSuicideLegal = true  #Is multiple-stone suicide legal? (Single-stone suicide is always illegal).

# hasButton = false # Set to true when area scoring to award 0.5 points to the first pass.

# whiteHandicapBonus = 0    # In handicap games, give white no compensation for black's handicap stones (Tromp-taylor, NZ, JP)
# whiteHandicapBonus = N-1  # In handicap games, give white N-1 points for black's handicap stones (AGA)

# Bot behavior---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Resignation -------------

# Resignation occurs if for at least resignConsecTurns in a row,
# the winLossUtility (which is on a [-1,1] scale) is below resignThreshold.

# Uncomment to make katago not resign close games, behind by fewer than this many points
# resignMinScoreDifference = 10

# Handicap -------------

# Assume that if black makes many moves in a row right at the start of the game, then the game is a handicap game.
# This is necessary on some servers and for some GUIs and also when initializing from many SGF files, which may
# set up a handicap games using repeated GTP "play" commands for black rather than GTP "place_free_handicap" commands.
# However, it may also lead to incorrect understanding of komi if whiteHandicapBonus is used and a server does NOT
# have such a practice.
# Defaults to true! Uncomment and set to false to disable this behavior.
# assumeMultipleStartingBlackMovesAreHandicap = true

# Makes katago dynamically adjust in handicap or altered-komi games to assume it is stronger or weaker than the opponent
# based on those game settings making sense, greatly improving handicap strength but biasing winrates and scores.
# Does NOT affect analysis (lz-analyze, kata-analyze, used by programs like Lizzie) so analysis remains unbiased.
# Uncomment and set this to 0 to disable this and make KataGo play the same always.
# dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead = 0.045

# Instead of a dynamic level, you can uncomment this and set this to a value from -3.0 to 3.0 to set KataGo's aggression to a FIXED level.
# DOES affect analysis (lz-analyze, kata-analyze, used by programs like Lizzie).
# Negative makes KataGo behave as if it is much weaker than the opponent, preferring to play defensively.
# Positive makes KataGo behave as if it is much stronger than the opponent, prefering to play aggressively or even overplay slightly.
# If this and "dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead" are BOTH set then dynamic will be used for all games and this fixed
# value will be used for analysis tools.
# playoutDoublingAdvantage = 0.0

# Uncommenting one of these will enforce that the FIXED playoutDoublingAdvantage will only apply when KataGo plays the specified color
# and will be negated when playing the opposite color.
# playoutDoublingAdvantagePla = BLACK
# playoutDoublingAdvantagePla = WHITE

# Passing and cleanup -------------

# Make the bot never assume that its pass will end the game, even if passing would end and "win" under Tromp-Taylor rules.
# Usually this is a good idea when using it for analysis or playing on servers where scoring may be implemented non-tromp-taylorly.
# Defaults to true! Uncomment and set to false to disable this.
# conservativePass = true

# When using territory scoring, self-play games continue beyond two passes with special cleanup
# rules that may be confusing for human players. This option prevents the special cleanup phases from being
# reachable when using the bot for GTP play.
# Defaults to true! Uncomment and set to false if you want KataGo to be able to enter special cleanup.
# For example, if you are testing it against itself, or against another bot that has precisely implemented the rules
# documented at https://lightvector.github.io/KataGo/rules.html
# preventCleanupPhase = true

# Misc Behavior --------------------

# Uncomment and set to true to make KataGo avoid a particular joseki that some KataGo nets misevaluate,
# and also to improve opening diversity versus some particular other bots that like to play it all the time.

# GPU Settings-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Maximum number of positions to send to a single GPU at once.

# if you are running out of memory, or if you are using multiple GPUs that expect to split
# up the work.
