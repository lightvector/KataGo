# Configuration for KataGo C++ GTP engine

# Run the program using: `./katago.exe gtp`

# In this example config, when a parameter is given as a commented out value,
# that value also is the default value, unless described otherwise. You can
# uncomment it (remove the pound sign) and change it if you want.

# ===========================================================================
# Running on an online server or in a real tournament or match
# ===========================================================================
# If you plan to run online or in a tournament, read through the "Rules"
# section below for proper handling of komi, handicaps, end-of-game cleanup,
# and other details.

# ===========================================================================
# Notes about performance and memory usage
# ===========================================================================
# Important: For good performance, you will very likely want to tune the
# "numSearchThreads" parameter in the Search limits section below! Run
# "./katago benchmark" to test KataGo and to suggest a reasonable value
# of this parameter.

# For multi-GPU systems, read "OpenCL GPU settings" or "CUDA GPU settings".
#
# When using OpenCL, verify that KataGo picks the correct device! Some systems
# may have both an Intel CPU OpenCL and GPU OpenCL. If # KataGo picks the wrong
# one, correct this by specifying "openclGpuToUse".
#
# Consider adjusting "maxVisits", "ponderingEnabled", "resignThreshold", and
# other parameters depending on your intended usage.

# ===========================================================================
# Command-line usage
# ===========================================================================
# All of the below values may be set or overridden via command-line arguments:
#
# -override-config KEY=VALUE,KEY=VALUE,...

# ===========================================================================
# Logs and files
# ===========================================================================
# This section defines where and what logging information is produced.

# Each run of KataGo will log to a separate file in this dir.
# This is the default.
logDir = gtp_logs
# Uncomment and specify this instead of logDir to write separate dated subdirs
# logDirDated = gtp_logs
# Uncomment and specify this instead of logDir to log to only a single file
# logFile = gtp.log

# Logging options
logAllGTPCommunication = true
logSearchInfo = true
logToStderr = false

# KataGo will display some info to stderr on GTP startup
# Uncomment the next line and set it to false to suppress that and remain silent
# startupPrintMessageToStderr = true

# Write information to stderr, for use in things like malkovich chat to OGS.
# ogsChatToStderr = false

# Uncomment and set this to a directory to override where openCLTuner files
# and other cached data is written. By default it saves into a subdir of the
# current directory on windows, and a subdir of ~/.katago on Linux.
# homeDataDir = PATH_TO_DIRECTORY

# ===========================================================================
# Analysis
# ===========================================================================
# This section configures analysis settings.
#
# The maximum number of moves after the first move displayed in variations
# from analysis commands like kata-analyze or lz-analyze.
# analysisPVLen = 15

# Report winrates for chat and analysis as (BLACK|WHITE|SIDETOMOVE).
# Most GUIs and analysis tools will expect SIDETOMOVE.
# reportAnalysisWinratesAs = SIDETOMOVE

# Extra noise for wider exploration. Large values will force KataGo to
# analyze a greater variety of moves than it normally would.
# An extreme value like 1 distributes playouts across every move on the board,
# even very bad moves.
# Affects analysis only, does not affect play.

# analysisWideRootNoise = 0.04

# ===========================================================================
# Rules
# ===========================================================================
# This section configures the scoring and playing rules. Rules can also be
# changed mid-run by issuing custom GTP commands.
#
# See https://lightvector.github.io/KataGo/rules.html for rules details.
#
# See https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/blob/master/docs/GTP_Extensions.md
# for GTP commands.

# Specify the rules as a string.
# Some legal values include:
#   chinese, japanese, korean, aga, chinese-ogs, new-zealand, stone-scoring,
#   ancient-territory, bga, aga-button
#
# For some human rulesets that require complex adjudication in tricky cases
# (e.g. japanese, korean) KataGo may not precisely match the ruleset in such
# cases but will do its best.
rules = tromp-taylor

# By default, the "rules" parameter is used, but if you comment it out and
# uncomment one option in each of the sections below, you can specify an
# arbitrary combination of individual rules.

# koRule = SIMPLE       # Simple ko rules (triple ko = no result)
# koRule = POSITIONAL   # Positional superko
# koRule = SITUATIONAL  # Situational superko

# scoringRule = AREA       # Area scoring
# scoringRule = TERRITORY  # Territory scoring (special computer-friendly territory rules)

# taxRule = NONE  # All surrounded empty points are scored
# taxRule = SEKI  # Eyes in seki do NOT count as points
# taxRule = ALL   # All groups are taxed up to 2 points for the two eyes needed to live

# Is multiple-stone suicide legal? (Single-stone suicide is always illegal).
# multiStoneSuicideLegal = false
# multiStoneSuicideLegal = true

# "Button go" - the first pass when area scoring awards 0.5 points and does
# not count for ending the game.
# Allows area scoring rulesets that have far simpler rules to achieve the same
# final scoring precision and reward for precise play as territory scoring.
# hasButton = false
# hasButton = true

# Is this a human ruleset where it's okay to pass before having physically
# captured and removed all dead stones?
# friendlyPassOk = false
# friendlyPassOk = true

# How handicap stones in handicap games are compensated
# whiteHandicapBonus = 0    # White gets no compensation for black's handicap stones (Tromp-taylor, NZ, JP)
# whiteHandicapBonus = N-1  # White gets N-1 points for black's N handicap stones (AGA)
# whiteHandicapBonus = N    # White gets N points for black's N handicap stones (Chinese)

# resignMinScoreDifference = 10

# ------------------------------
# Handicap
# ------------------------------
# Assume that if black makes many moves in a row right at the start of the
# game, then the game is a handicap game. This is necessary on some servers
# and for some GUIs and also when initializing from many SGF files, which may
# set up a handicap game using repeated GTP "play" commands for black rather
# than GTP "place_free_handicap" commands; however, it may also lead to
# incorrect understanding of komi if whiteHandicapBonus is used and a server
# does not have such a practice. Uncomment and set to false to disable.
# assumeMultipleStartingBlackMovesAreHandicap = true

# Makes katago dynamically adjust in handicap or altered-komi games to assume
# based on those game settings that it must be stronger or weaker than the
# opponent and to play accordingly. Greatly improves handicap strength by
# biasing winrates and scores to favor appropriate safe/aggressive play.
# Does not affect analysis (lz-analyze, kata-analyze, used by programs like
# Lizzie) so analysis remains unbiased. Uncomment and set this to 0 to disable
# this and make KataGo play the same always.
# dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead = 0.045

# Instead of "dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead", you can comment
# that out and uncomment and set "playoutDoublingAdvantage" to a value between
# from -3.0 to 3.0 to set KataGo's aggression to a FIXED level. This affects
# analysis tools (lz-analyze, kata-analyze, used by programs like Lizzie).
# Negative makes KataGo behave as if it is much weaker than the opponent,
# preferring to play defensively. Positive makes KataGo behave as if it is
# much stronger than the opponent, prefering to play aggressively or even
# overplay slightly.
#
# If this and "dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead" are both set
# then dynamic will be used for all games and this fixed value will be used
# for analysis tools.
# playoutDoublingAdvantage = 0.0

# Uncomment one of these when using "playoutDoublingAdvantage" to enforce
# that it will only apply when KataGo plays as the specified color and will be

# playoutDoublingAdvantagePla = WHITE

# ------------------------------
# Passing and cleanup
# ------------------------------
# Make the bot never assume that its pass will end the game, even if passing
# would end and "win" under Tromp-Taylor rules. Usually this is a good idea
# when using it for analysis or playing on servers where scoring may be
# implemented non-tromp-taylorly. Uncomment and set to false to disable.
# conservativePass = true

# When using territory scoring, self-play games continue beyond two passes
# with special cleanup rules that may be confusing for human players. This
# option prevents the special cleanup phases from being reachable when using
# the bot for GTP play. Uncomment and set to false to enable entering special
# cleanup. For example, if you are testing it against itself, or against
# another bot that has precisely implemented the rules documented at
# https://lightvector.github.io/KataGo/rules.html
# preventCleanupPhase = true

# ------------------------------
# Miscellaneous behavior

# ===========================================================================
# Search limits
# ===========================================================================

# Terminology:
# "Playouts" is the number of new playouts of search performed each turn.
# "Visits" is the same as "Playouts" but also counts search performed on
# previous turns that is still applicable to this turn.
# "Time" is the time in seconds.

# For example, if KataGo searched 200 nodes on the previous turn, and then
# after the opponent's reply, 50 nodes of its search tree was still valid,
# then a visit limit of 200 would allow KataGo to search 150 new nodes
# (for a final tree size of 200 nodes), whereas a playout limit of of 200
# would allow KataGo to search 200 nodes (for a final tree size of 250 nodes).

# Additionally, KataGo may also move before than the limit in order to
# obey time controls (e.g. byo-yomi, etc) if the GTP controller has
# told KataGo that the game has is being played with a given time control.

# Limits for search on the current turn.
# If commented out or unspecified, the default is to have no limit.

# Setting this to 150% of the visits/s you normally get on your hardware makes KataGo play approximately equally fast as the opponent.
# Useful if you're running a ranked bot on a go server, and you want to be friendly if the opponent is also playing fast.
# friendlyMaxVisitsFactor = 500

# Ponder on the opponent's turn?
