# Configuration for KataGo C++ GTP engine

# Run the program using: `./katago.exe gtp`

# In this example config, when a parameter is given as a commented out value,
# that value also is the default value, unless described otherwise. You can
# uncomment it (remove the pound sign) and change it if you want.

# ===========================================================================
# Running on an online server or in a real tournament or match
# ===========================================================================
# If you plan to run online or in a tournament, read through the "Rules"
# section below for proper handling of komi, handicaps, end-of-game cleanup,
# and other details.

# ===========================================================================
# Notes about performance and memory usage
# ===========================================================================
# Important: For good performance, you will very likely want to tune the
# "numSearchThreads" parameter in the Search limits section below! Run
# "./katago benchmark" to test KataGo and to suggest a reasonable value
# of this parameter.

# For multi-GPU systems, read "OpenCL GPU settings" or "CUDA GPU settings".
#
# When using OpenCL, verify that KataGo picks the correct device! Some systems
# may have both an Intel CPU OpenCL and GPU OpenCL. If # KataGo picks the wrong
# one, correct this by specifying "openclGpuToUse".
#
# Consider adjusting "maxVisits", "ponderingEnabled", "resignThreshold", and
# other parameters depending on your intended usage.

# ===========================================================================
# Command-line usage
# ===========================================================================
# All of the below values may be set or overridden via command-line arguments:
#
# -override-config KEY=VALUE,KEY=VALUE,...

# ===========================================================================
# Logs and files
# ===========================================================================
# This section defines where and what logging information is produced.

# Each run of KataGo will log to a separate file in this dir.
# This is the default.

#
# For some human rulesets that require complex adjudication in tricky cases
# (e.g. japanese, korean) KataGo may not precisely match the ruleset in such
# cases but will do its best.

# Handicap
# ------------------------------
# Assume that if black makes many moves in a row right at the start of the
# game, then the game is a handicap game. This is necessary on some servers
# and for some GUIs and also when initializing from many SGF files, which may
# set up a handicap game using repeated GTP "play" commands for black rather
# than GTP "place_free_handicap" commands; however, it may also lead to

# assumeMultipleStartingBlackMovesAreHandicap = true

# Makes katago dynamically adjust in handicap or altered-komi games to assume
# based on those game settings that it must be stronger or weaker than the

# biasing winrates and scores to favor appropriate safe/aggressive play.
# Does NOT affect analysis (lz-analyze, kata-analyze, used by programs like
# Lizzie) so analysis remains unbiased. Uncomment and set this to 0 to disable
# this and make KataGo play the same always.
# dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead = 0.045

# Instead of "dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead", you can comment
# that out and uncomment and set "playoutDoublingAdvantage" to a fixed value
# from -3.0 to 3.0 that will not change dynamically.
# ALSO affects analysis tools (lz-analyze, kata-analyze, used by e.g. Lizzie).
# Negative makes KataGo behave as if it is much weaker than the opponent.
# Positive makes KataGo behave as if it is much stronger than the opponent.
# KataGo will adjust to favor safe/aggressive play as appropriate based on
# the combination of who is ahead and how much stronger/weaker it thinks it is,
# and report winrates and scores taking the strength difference into account.
#
# If this and "dynamicPlayoutDoublingAdvantageCapPerOppLead" are both set

# for analysis tools.

# Passing and cleanup
# ------------------------------
# Make the bot never assume that its pass will end the game, even if passing

# ===========================================================================
# Search limits
# ===========================================================================

# Terminology:
# "Playouts" is the number of new playouts of search performed each turn.
# "Visits" is the same as "Playouts" but also counts search performed on
# previous turns that is still applicable to this turn.
# "Time" is the time in seconds.

# For example, if KataGo searched 200 nodes on the previous turn, and then
# after the opponent's reply, 50 nodes of its search tree was still valid,
# then a visit limit of 200 would allow KataGo to search 150 new nodes
# (for a final tree size of 200 nodes), whereas a playout limit of of 200
# would allow KataGo to search 200 nodes (for a final tree size of 250 nodes).

# Additionally, KataGo may also move before than the limit in order to
# obey time controls (e.g. byo-yomi, etc) if the GTP controller has
# told KataGo that the game has is being played with a given time control.

# Limits for search on the current turn.

# Automatic avoid patterns
# ===========================================================================
# The parameters in this section provide a way to bias away from moves that match
# patterns that this instance of KataGo has played in previous games, by auto-saving
# moves to a directory and then auto-loading and biasing against them each new game.
# Uncomment them to use them. When using this feature, all parameters must be specified.

# Different board sizes are tracked separately, but all board sizes share the same
# parameters by default. Every parameter *except* for autoAvoidRepeatDir and
# autoAvoidRepeatSaveChunkSize can be overridden per board size,
# e.g. "autoAvoidRepeatMinTurnNumber13x13". You must ALSO specify the
# defaults even if you have specified board-size-specific values.

# Directory to auto-save moves KataGo plays, to avoid them in future games.
# You can create a new empty directory and put its path here.
# If you run parallel instances of KataGo, use different directories if you
# want them not to share their biases, use the same directory if you want
# all of them to bias away from past moves that any of them have played.
# KataGo will also automatically DELETE old data in this directory, so it is
# recommended that if you do share the same directory between parallel instances,
# that they all use the same settings that affect data saving/deletion.
# autoAvoidRepeatDir = PATH_TO_NEW_DIRECTORY

# Penalize this much utility per matching move.
# Values that are too large may lead to bad play. The value of 0.004 is fairly large
# and might be large enough to result in some early weird/bad moves when trying
# to avoid past games' moves if enough games begin the same way. You can experiment with it.
# autoAvoidRepeatUtility = 0.004

# Per each new move saved, exponentially decay prior saved moves by this factor.
# This way, the bias against moves from many games ago is gradually phased out.
# For example, 0.9995 = 1 - 1/2000, so would be roughly 2000 prior moves worth of
# penalty weight remembered, in steady state. Depending on what turn number range
# you are saving, this might equate to a different number of games For example
# saving the first 50 moves per game would make this roughly 2000 / 50 = 40 games
# worth of memory.
# autoAvoidRepeatLambda = 0.9995

# Affects data saving/deletion.
# When the number of saved moves exceeds this, outright delete them to avoid too many
# files and disk space building up. Also may affect the speed of saving/loading on start
# of each game if this is set large and a lot of data builds up.
# autoAvoidRepeatMaxPoses = 10000

# Load SGF files from this directory when the engine is started
# (only on startup, will not reload unless engine is restarted)

# You can also surround the file path in double quotes if the file path contains trailing spaces or hash signs.
# Within double quotes, backslashes are escape characters.
# avoidSgfPatternDirs = "path/to/directory/with/sgfs/"
