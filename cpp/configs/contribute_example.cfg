# How many games should KataGo play at once? For good GPUs, putting too small a number here will be *very* inefficient.
# For absolute-top-tier GPUs, try numbers like 32, 40, 64, etc.
# For modern good middle-tier GPUs, you can try numbers like 8 or 16.
# For very old or weak GPUs, or if you want KataGo to put less load on your system, try 4.
maxSimultaneousGames = Fill in a number here

# Set to true if you want one of KataGo's games to be streamed to a text file, so you can watch.
# Follow in a separate shell with a command like the following:
# Linux: "tail -f watchgame.txt"
# Windows Powershell: "Get-Content .\watchgame.txt -Tail 50 -Wait"

# KataGo will only use one GPU by default. You can edit the below if you have multiple GPUs and want to use them all.


# TO USE MULTIPLE GPUS:
# Set this to the number of GPUs you have and/or would like to use.
# **AND** if it is more than 1, uncomment the appropriate CUDA or OpenCL section below.
# numNNServerThreadsPerModel = 1


# CUDA GPU settings--------------------------------------
# These only apply when using the CUDA version of KataGo.

# IF USING ONE GPU: optionally uncomment and change this if the GPU you want to use turns out to be not device 0
# cudaDeviceToUse = 0

# IF USING TWO GPUS: Uncomment these two lines (AND set numNNServerThreadsPerModel above):
# cudaDeviceToUseThread0 = 0  # change this if the first GPU you want to use turns out to be not device 0
# cudaDeviceToUseThread1 = 1  # change this if the second GPU you want to use turns out to be not device 1

# IF USING THREE GPUS: Uncomment these three lines (AND set numNNServerThreadsPerModel above):
# cudaDeviceToUseThread0 = 0  # change this if the first GPU you want to use turns out to be not device 0
# cudaDeviceToUseThread1 = 1  # change this if the second GPU you want to use turns out to be not device 1
# cudaDeviceToUseThread2 = 2  # change this if the third GPU you want to use turns out to be not device 2

# You can probably guess the pattern if you have four, five, etc. GPUs.

# KataGo will automatically use FP16 or not based on the compute capability of your NVIDIA GPU. If you
# want to try to force a particular behavior though you can uncomment these lines and change them
# to "true" or "false". E.g. it's using FP16 but on your card that's giving an error, or it's not using
# FP16 but you think it should.
# cudaUseFP16 = auto
# cudaUseNHWC = auto


# OpenCL GPU settings--------------------------------------
# These only apply when using the OpenCL version of KataGo.

# Uncomment to tune OpenCL for every board size separately, rather than only the largest possible size
# openclReTunePerBoardSize = true

# IF USING ONE GPU: optionally uncomment and change this if the best device to use is guessed incorrectly.
# The default behavior tries to guess the 'best' GPU or device on your system to use, usually it will be a good guess.
# openclDeviceToUse = 0

# IF USING TWO GPUS: Uncomment these two lines and replace X and Y with the device ids of the devices you want to use.
# It might NOT be 0 and 1, some computers will have many OpenCL devices. You can see what the devices are when
# KataGo starts up - it should print or log all the devices it finds.
# (AND also set numNNServerThreadsPerModel above)
# openclDeviceToUseThread0 = X
# openclDeviceToUseThread1 = Y

# IF USING THREE GPUS: Uncomment these three lines and replace X and Y and Z with the device ids of the devices you want to use.
# It might NOT be 0 and 1 and 2, some computers will have many OpenCL devices. You can see what the devices are when
# KataGo starts up - it should print or log all the devices it finds.
# (AND also set numNNServerThreadsPerModel above)
# openclDeviceToUseThread0 = X
# openclDeviceToUseThread1 = Y
# openclDeviceToUseThread2 = Z

# You can probably guess the pattern if you have four, five, etc. GPUs.

# KataGo will automatically use FP16 or not based on testing your GPU during tuning. If you
# want to try to force a particular behavior though you can uncomment this lines and change it
# to "true" or "false". This is a fairly blunt setting - more detailed settings are testable
# by rerunning the tuner with various arguments.
# openclUseFP16 = auto


# Eigen-specific settings--------------------------------------
# These only apply when using the Eigen (pure CPU) version of KataGo.

# This is the number of CPU threads for evaluating the neural net on the Eigen backend.
# It defaults to numSearchThreads.
# numEigenThreadsPerModel = X
