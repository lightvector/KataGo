# SEE NOTES ABOUT numSearchThreads AND OTHER IMPORTANT PARAMS BELOW!

# Logs------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Where to output log?
logDir = analysis_logs  # Each run of KataGo will log to a separate file in this dir
# logFile = analysis.log  # Use this instead of logDir to just specify a single file directly
# logToStderr = true      # Echo everything output to log file to stderr as well
# logAllRequests = false  # Log all input lines received to the analysis engine.
# logAllResponses = false # Log all lines output to stdout from the analysis engine.
# logSearchInfo = false   # Log debug info for every search performed

# Analysis------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Controls the number of moves after the first move in a variation.
# analysisPVLen = 15

# Report winrates for analysis as (BLACK|WHITE|SIDETOMOVE).
reportAnalysisWinratesAs = BLACK

# Uncomment and and set to a positive value to make KataGo explore the top move(s) less deeply and accurately,
# but explore and give evaluations to a greater variety of moves, for analysis (does NOT affect play).
# A value like 0.03 or 0.06 will give various mildly but still noticeably wider searches.
# An extreme value like 1 will distribute many playouts across every move on the board, even very bad moves.
# wideRootNoise = 0.0

# Bot behavior---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Handicap -------------

# Assume that if black makes many moves in a row right at the start of the game, then the game is a handicap game.
# This is necessary on some servers and for some GUIs and also when initializing from many SGF files, which may
# set up a handicap game using repeated GTP "play" commands for black rather than GTP "place_free_handicap" commands.
# However, it may also lead to incorrect understanding of komi if whiteHandicapBonus is used and a server does NOT
# have such a practice.
# Defaults to true! Uncomment and set to false to disable this behavior.
# assumeMultipleStartingBlackMovesAreHandicap = true

# Passing and cleanup -------------

# Make the bot never assume that its pass will end the game, even if passing would end and "win" under Tromp-Taylor rules.
# Usually this is a good idea when using it for analysis or playing on servers where scoring may be implemented non-tromp-taylorly.
# Defaults to true! Uncomment and set to false to disable this.
# conservativePass = true

# When using territory scoring, self-play games continue beyond two passes with special cleanup
# rules that may be confusing for human players. This option prevents the special cleanup phases from being
# reachable when using the bot for GTP play.
# Defaults to true! Uncomment and set to false if you want KataGo to be able to enter special cleanup.
# For example, if you are testing it against itself, or against another bot that has precisely implemented the rules
# documented at https://lightvector.github.io/KataGo/rules.html
# preventCleanupPhase = true

# Search limits-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# By default, if NOT specified in an individual request, limit maximum number of root visits per search to this much
maxVisits = 500
# If provided, cap search time at this many seconds
# maxTime = 60

# Search threads, batching, GPUs--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Try a configuration like this if you only expect the engine to be handling a few queries at a time and you want
# individual queries to return more quickly, and are okay with the results being a bit lower-quality and the overall
# peak throughput on queries to be lower.
numAnalysisThreads = 2
numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread = 16

# Try a configuration like this if you expect to be sending large numbers of queries at a time, and want to maximize
# total throughput and also the evaluation quality of all the queries and you never care about the response latency
# of the individual queries, only the throughput as a whole.
# numAnalysisThreads = 32
# numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread = 1

# You will want to increase one or both numbers if you have a powerful GPU, and possibly decrease one or both if you
# have a very weak GPU, and play with the balance between them depending on your use case.
# Read the explanation below to understand how to set these parameters:

# EXPLANATION:
# numAnalysisThreads:                 the number of POSITIONS to be able to search in parallel.
# numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread:  the number of threads to use in the tree search for EACH position.
# (older analysis configs might just have 'numSearchThreads', this is an alias for 'numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread')

# Therefore, the total number of search threads that may be active at a given time could be as large as the product:
# numAnalysisThreads * numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread

# Searching more positions in parallel is more efficient since the different threads aren't conflicting with each
# other on the same MCTS search tree. Using multiple threads on the same search will both make things slower
# and weaken the search (holding playouts fixed) due to out of date statistics on nodes and suboptimal exploration,
# although the cost is minor for only 2,4,8 threads.

# So unlike in GTP, which only ever searches one position at a time and where therefore you might as well make
# numSearchThreads as large as possible, in the analysis engine you often want you often want to keep numSearchThreads small,
# and instead parallelize across positions, so you can reduce conflict between threads and improve the overall throughput
# and strength of the search.

# But obviously you only get the benefit of parallelization across positions when you actually have lots of positions
# that you are querying at once! For example, setting numAnalysisThreads = 8 is useless if you only ever send one or two
# queries at a time!

# Therefore:
# * If you plan to use the analysis engine only for batch processing large numbers of positions,
#   it's preferable to numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread to only a small number (e.g. 1,2,4) and use a higher numAnalysisThreads.
# * But if you sometimes plan to query the analysis engine for single positions, or otherwise in smaller quantities
#   than -num-analysis-threads, or if you plan to be user-interactive such that the response time on some individual
#   analysis requests is important to keep low, then set numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread to a larger number and use
#   a lower numAnalysisThreads. That way, individual searches complete faster due to having more threads on each one.

# For 19x19 boards, weaker GPUs probably want a TOTAL number of threads (numAnalysisThreads * numSearchThreadsPerAnalysisThread)
# between 4 and 32. Mid-tier GPUs probably between 16 and 64. Strong GPUs probably between 32 and 256.
# But there's no substitute for experimenting and seeing what's best for your hardware and your usage case.

# Keep in mind that the number of threads you want does NOT necessarily have much to do with how many cores you have on your
# system. The optimal may easily exceed the number of cores! GPU batching is (usually) the dominant consideration.

# -------------

# nnMaxBatchSize is the max number of positions to send to a single GPU at once. Generally, it should be the case that:
# (number of GPUs you will use * nnMaxBatchSize) >= (numSearchThreads * num-analysis-threads)
# That way, when each threads tries to request a GPU eval, your batch size summed across GPUs is large enough to handle them
# all at once. However, it can be sensible to set this a little smaller if you are limited on GPU memory,
# too large a number may fail if the GPU doesn't have enough memory.
nnMaxBatchSize = 64

# Uncomment and set these smaller if you are going to use the analysis engine EXCLUSIVELY for smaller boards (or plan to
# run multiple instances, with some instances only handling smaller boards). It should improve performance.
# It may also mean you can use more threads profitably.
# maxBoardXSizeForNNBuffer = 19
# maxBoardYSizeForNNBuffer = 19

# TO USE MULTIPLE GPUS:
# Uncomment and set this to the number of GPUs you have and/or would like to use...
# AND if it is more than 1, uncomment the appropriate CUDA or OpenCL section below.
# numNNServerThreadsPerModel = 1

# Other General GPU Settings-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Cache up to 2 ** this many neural net evaluations in case of transpositions in the tree.
