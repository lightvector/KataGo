# Compiling KataGo
KataGo is written in C++. It should compile on Linux or OSX via g++ that supports at least C++14, or on Windows via MSVC 15 (2017) and later. Other compilers and systems have not been tested yet. This is recommended if you want to run the full KataGo self-play training loop on your own and/or do your own research and experimentation, or if you want to run KataGo on an operating system for which there is no precompiled executable available.

## Linux
   * Requirements
      * CMake with a minimum version of 3.10.2 - for example `sudo apt install cmake` on Debian, or download from https://cmake.org/download/ if that doesn't give you a recent-enough version.
      * Some version of g++ that supports at least C++14.
      * If using the OpenCL backend, a modern GPU that supports OpenCL 1.2 or greater, or else something like [this](https://software.intel.com/en-us/opencl-sdk) for CPU. But if using CPU, Eigen should be better.
      * If using the CUDA backend, CUDA 10.2 with CUDNN 7.6.5, or CUDA 11.1 with CUDNN 8.0.4 (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) and a GPU capable of supporting them. I'm unsure how version compatibility works with CUDA, there's a good chance that later versions than these work just as well, but they have not been tested.
      * If using the Eigen backend, Eigen3. With Debian packages, (i.e. apt or apt-get), this should be `libeigen3-dev`.
      * zlib, libzip. With Debian packages (i.e. apt or apt-get), these should be `zlib1g-dev`, `libzip-dev`.
      * If you want to do self-play training and research, probably Google perftools `libgoogle-perftools-dev` for TCMalloc or some other better malloc implementation. For unknown reasons, the allocation pattern in self-play with large numbers of threads and parallel games causes a lot of memory fragmentation under glibc malloc that will eventually run your machine out of memory, but better mallocs handle it fine.
      * If compiling to contribute to public distributed training runs, OpenSSL is required (`libssl-dev`).
   * Clone this repo:
      * `git clone https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo.git`
   * Compile using CMake and make in the cpp directory:
      * `cd KataGo/cpp`
      * `cmake . -DUSE_BACKEND=OPENCL` or `cmake . -DUSE_BACKEND=CUDA` or `cmake . -DUSE_BACKEND=EIGEN` depending on which backend you want.
         * Specify also `-DUSE_TCMALLOC=1` if using TCMalloc.
         * Compiling will also call git commands to embed the git hash into the compiled executable, specify also `-DNO_GIT_REVISION=1` to disable it if this is causing issues for you.
         * Specify `-DUSE_AVX2=1` to also compile Eigen with AVX2 and FMA support, which will make it incompatible with old CPUs but much faster. (If you want to go further, you can also add `-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS='-march=native'` which will specialize to precisely your machine's CPU, but the exe might not run on other machines at all).
         * Specify `-DBUILD_DISTRIBUTED=1` to compile with support for contributing data to public distributed training runs.
            * If building distributed, you will also need to build with Git revision support, including building within a clone of the repo, as opposed to merely an unzipped copy of its source.
            * Only builds from specific tagged versions or branches can contribute, in particlar, either the latest release tag (e.g. v1.8.0) or the dedicated `distributed` branch. To minimize the chance of any data incompatibilities or bugs, please do NOT attempt to contribute with custom changes or circumvent these limitations.
      * `make`
   * Done! You should now have a compiled `katago` executable in your working directory.
   * Pre-trained neural nets are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/releases) or more from [here](https://d3dndmfyhecmj0.cloudfront.net/g170/index.html).
   * You will probably want to edit `configs/gtp_example.cfg` (see "Tuning for Performance" above).
   * If using OpenCL, you will want to verify that KataGo is picking up the correct device when you run it (e.g. some systems may have both an Intel CPU OpenCL and GPU OpenCL, if KataGo appears to pick the wrong one, you can correct this by specifying `openclGpuToUse` in `configs/gtp_example.cfg`).

## Windows
   * Requirements
      * CMake with a minimum version of 3.10.2, GUI version strongly recommended (https://cmake.org/download/)
      * Microsoft Visual Studio for C++. Version 15 (2017) has been tested and should work, other versions might work as well.
      * If using the OpenCL backend, a modern GPU that supports OpenCL 1.2 or greater, or else something like [this](https://software.intel.com/en-us/opencl-sdk) for CPU. But if using CPU, Eigen should be better.
      * If using the CUDA backend, CUDA 10.2 with CUDNN 7.6.5, or CUDA 11.1 with CUDNN 8.0.4 (https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) and a GPU capable of supporting them. I'm unsure how version compatibility works with CUDA, there's a good chance that later versions than these work just as well, but they have not been tested.
      * If using the Eigen backend, Eigen3, version 3.3.x. (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Download).
      * zlib. The following package might work, https://www.nuget.org/packages/zlib-vc140-static-64/, or alternatively you can build it yourself via something like: https://github.com/kiyolee/zlib-win-build
      * libzip (optional, needed only for self-play training) - for example https://github.com/kiyolee/libzip-win-build
      * If compiling to contribute to public distributed training runs, OpenSSL is required (https://www.openssl.org/, https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Compilation_and_Installation).
   * Download/clone this repo to some folder `KataGo`.
   * Configure using CMake GUI and compile in MSVC:
      * Select `KataGo/cpp` as the source code directory in [CMake GUI](https://cmake.org/runningcmake/).
      * Set the build directory to wherever you would like the built executable to be produced.
      * Click "Configure". For the generator select your MSVC version, and also select "x64" for the optional platform if you're on 64-bit windows, don't use win32.
      * If you get errors where CMake has not automatically found ZLib, point it to the appropriate places according to the error messages:
        * `ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR` - point this to the directory containing `zlib.h` and other headers
        * `ZLIB_LIBRARY` - point this to the `libz.lib` resulting from building zlib. Note that "*_LIBRARY" expects to be pointed to the ".lib" file, whereas the ".dll" file is the file that needs to be included with KataGo at runtime.
      * Also set `USE_BACKEND` to `OPENCL` or `CUDA`, or `EIGEN` depending on what backend you want to use.
      * Set any other options you want and re-run "Configure" again as needed after setting them. Such as:
         * `NO_GIT_REVISION` if you don't have Git or if cmake is not finding it.
         * `NO_LIBZIP` if you don't care about running self-play training and you don't have libzip.
         * `USE_AVX2` if you want to compile with AVX2 and FMA instructions, which will fail on some CPUs but speed up Eigen greatly on CPUs that support them.
         * `BUILD_DISTRIBUTED` to compile with support for contributing data to public distributed training runs.
            * If building distributed, you will also need to build with Git revision support, including building within a clone of the repo, as opposed to merely an unzipped copy of its source.
            * Only builds from specific tagged versions or branches can contribute, in particlar, either the latest release tag (e.g. v1.8.0) or the dedicated `distributed` branch. To minimize the chance of any data incompatibilities or bugs, please do NOT attempt to contribute with custom changes or circumvent these limitations.
      * Once running "Configure" looks good, run "Generate" and then open MSVC and build as normal in MSVC.
   * Done! You should now have a compiled `katago.exe` executable in your working directory.
   * Note: You may need to copy the ".dll" files corresponding to the various ".lib" files you compiled with into the directory containing katago.exe.
   * Note: If you had to update or install CUDA or GPU drivers, you will likely need to reboot before they will work.
   * Pre-trained neural nets are available on the [releases page](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/releases) or more from [here](https://d3dndmfyhecmj0.cloudfront.net/g170/index.html).
   * You will probably want to edit `configs/gtp_example.cfg` (see "Tuning for Performance" above).
   * If using OpenCL, you will want to verify that KataGo is picking up the correct device (e.g. some systems may have both an Intel CPU OpenCL and GPU OpenCL, if KataGo appears to pick the wrong one, you can correct this by specifying `openclGpuToUse` in `configs/gtp_example.cfg`).
